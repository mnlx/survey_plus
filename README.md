#My django testing evironment

I use this repository to test new modules or apps designed for django. Many files are related to Heroku's platform specific way of launching apps.

##Currently using:

    -registration redux
    -django CMS
    -django rest framework
    -gunicorn and uwsgi
    -nginx server
