# Survey Site Setup

I use this repository to test new modules or apps designed for django. Many files are related to Heroku's platform specific way of launching apps.

## General Short-Term goals:
- setup a survey making site

## General Long-Term goals:
- add email deliverable surveys

###### LIBS:

    -registration redux
    -django rest framework
